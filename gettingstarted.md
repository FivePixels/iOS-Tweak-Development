# Getting Started

## Where do I begin in iOS Tweak Development?

To begin tweak development, there are a few essentials.

### Essentials

* A jailbroken iOS device \(_optional_, __but **highly** recommended\) $$^1$$ 
* A macOS computer \(can be _Windows_, __described below\) $$^2$$ 
* Basic understanding of C/Objective-C programming language  

$$^1$$ Having _at least_ one jailbroken device is extremely useful as you can deploy tweaks to your device to test them without relying on someone else to test your tweak for you.

$$^2$$ macOS is more prepared and set up for iOS development. Windows and Linux are still options for installation.
