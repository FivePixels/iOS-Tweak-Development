# Getting Started

## Where do I begin in iOS Tweak Development?

To begin tweak development, there are a few essentials.

### Essentials

* A jailbroken iOS device \(_optional_, __but **highly** recommended\)
* A macOS computer \(can be _Windows_, __described below\)
* Basic understanding of C/Objective-C programming language

Having _at least_ one jailbroken device is extremely useful as you can deploy tweaks to your device to test them without relying on someone else to test your tweak for you.

macOS is more prepared and set up for iOS development in general, so I would prefer installing onto this OS if possible. 

Having a basic understanding of the Objective-C language is needed to write tweaks.
