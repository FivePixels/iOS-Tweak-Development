# Getting Started

## What is a jailbreak?

A jailbreak is termed as a privilege escalation in the iOS software to allow for unauthorized modifications, extensions, and third-party tools to run at their own will within the device. The compound word is an analogy to what happens when you jailbreak your device - you set your device free, un-guarded by Apple's limits.

You can read more about **Jailbreak** under the Jailbreak Tab.

## What is an iOS Tweak?

To define an iOS tweak, think of it as a modification to a task that the iOS software or an application within the software carries out. To use a tweak, you must be **jailbroken**, as Apple doesn't allow unauthorized system modifications to be carried out.

## What are the intentions of tweaks?

To understand iOS Tweak Development, we should describe what it's usual intentions are:

* **Theming** - changing the entire look of your iOS.
* **Feature** **Implementation** - adding what Apple didn't add.
* **Feature** **Removal** - removing what Apple shouldn't add.
* **File** **System** **Exploration** - accessing and using the internal file system.
* **Jailbreak** **Bypass** - overriding methods to allow your existing tweaks to work alongside applications shared \(usually\) on the App Store.

These are just a few examples of what users can achieve when writing a iOS tweak.

## Why should I run tweaks on my device?

One of the main premises that follows both **jailbreaking** and **tweaking** of your iOS device is the ability to have device freedom. The intentions listed above are most commonly what people look forward to in tweaks. Most of iOS is secure, however,  jailbreaking your phone removes a barrier of protection, letting your device become more accessible to malware.
